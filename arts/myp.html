          <p>Arts in the MYP stimulate young imaginations, challenge perceptions and develop creative and analytical skills (IBO 2014). Today we present a selection of artworks where not only the art elements and principles of design can be seen but also they are the result of projects that have challenged our students to think critically and creatively, to think outside the box and come up with solutions in the middle of exploration.
            We have a great pleasure to introduce you to their final artworks of the 1st semester.</p>
